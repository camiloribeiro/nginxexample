# nginxexample

Simple nginx example to help a friend:

      - git clone git@github.com:camiloribeiro/nginxexample.git
      - cd nginxexample
      - docker-compose up

You will need only docker and docker-compose to try it.

Change the configuration as it pleases you. Remember you have to kill the containers and start it again in order to aply any config changes. (yep, I will maybe fix it in the future)
